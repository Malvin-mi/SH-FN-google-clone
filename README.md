**This is a team project thus required gitHub collaboration**

The first thing to do is to clone this repo to your local machine.
use the command 

> git clone https://github.com/Malvin-mi/SH-FN-google-clone.git

You would then run 

> yarn install or npm install

to install any dependecies. 

Then you can run;

> yarn start

to view on your localhost.

The next step would be to create branch where you push your work to. You would need to reach out to me to give you access.

In your terminal, to create new branch;

> git checkout -b featurename

Then you can carry out your work. To prevent any conflicts, everyone would create components for their features and then import it to the `app.js` file.

To import your component;

> `import ComponentName from ./component path`

after you are done, you push your work to your branch.

> git push -u origin featurename

Then submit a pull request to the main branch from your branch.

Upon merging, for submission sake we would run 

>yarn build 

and host the build folder.

 ### ***The code would be hosted on  either netlify or vercel***

 Hosted site would be shared soon.
